### How to Contribute

Within the Pages folder create your own folder following the naming convention "Name_USN" to add to the main website. You can write about any tricks or what you've learnt/your experience of Hacktoberfest (think like an article or blog post). If not about open-source, you can write about any of your experiences as a dev that you might want to share with us.

After having made the some files and written some code make your Pull Request. When you think you have finished the entire webpage you can add a link/card to your page from the main index.html homepage with your name and any picture of your choice from ./Pictures folder.

#### Before you do new work on the repo, you should pull any updates in from this original repo like this:

```

git pull

```

This takes all the changes on this repo and applies them to the fork to keep them in sync
